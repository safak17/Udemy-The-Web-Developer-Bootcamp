> When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard **CSS basic box model**. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.
>
> Every box is composed of four parts (or *areas*), defined by their respective edges: the *content edge*, *padding edge*, *border edge*, and *margin edge*.
